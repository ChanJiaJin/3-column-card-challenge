### The challenge ###

The challenge is to be able to replicate, as close as possible, to the provided project, a 3 column preview card component. Features and appearance of the original source must be replicated as much as possible to maintain originality. At the end, users should be able to:
	1) View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
	2) See the hover effect for interactive elements

## My process ###

1) Study the sample site and plan out the initial HTML layout
2) Write in HTML layout while deciding to use either CSS grid or Flexbox and structure them accordingly
3) Set up grid css and give all 3 boxes borders to have a better image of what I have done so far
4) Set up flexbox to give the inner elements a certain flow
5) Adjust elements' margins/paddings to make them look as close as the original
6) Add in background colours and button colours through the use of CSS variables
7) Tweaked with the buttons' CSS to give them the hover state transition
8) Changed all fonts to the required fonts as stated in the design README
9) Edited atribution line to have my name and remove text decorations

### Built with ###

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned ###

This being my first project outside of my own initiative has taught me abit about the importance of applying basics into what I do. Here I was able to try my had at applying basics and see how building a simple project will feel like. WHile it might look liek an easy task at first glance, it was in fact not at all easy per se. I had to turn to external resources suck as stack overflow and W3 schools to refresh and look for solutions to my issues. Most issues I faced, such as the hover state transition, had interesting solutions that taught me that doing CSS is more than just following textbook solutions, but mostly about being creative with what we know and making things interesting for users to see. With that, this project has given me a glimpse into what CSS has to offer, albeit a small one.


### Continued development ###

One area I will like to continue to focus on in future projects is to be able to be familiar with skills i have used in this project. I want to continue to develop the habit of using thing such as flexbox and grid, or common methods used in the industry to give myself a stable headstart.

### Useful resources ###

- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-media-queries-breakpoints-media-types-standard-resolutions-and-more/ - This helped me for to understand more about media queries and where are the normal breakpoints are.
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20590246/stop-an-element-moving-with-padding-on-hover - This taught me how to manipulate CSS for the buttons to have that white border on hover. It also taught me that CSS is more than just applying textboo techniques.
